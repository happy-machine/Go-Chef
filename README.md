Go Chef is a rails app which uses Google's api to locate a chef near you. 
A chef can add his location either by Postcode or by clicking on a map or geo location icon. He can then set a call out radius outside of which he will not be returned in a search.

## Reviews and gallery

A chef can curate his own gallery, and other users can leave reviews and pictures for each chef.
