Go Chef is a rails app which uses Google's api to locate a chef near you. 
A Chef can set up a call out radius, and location either by postcode or by clicking on a map or geo location icon.

## Reviews and gallery

A Chef can curate his own gallery, and other users can leave reviews and pictures for each chef.
